/**
 * Advances a shipment's progress based on real elapsed time, server-side, so it moves
 * forward whether or not anyone is watching it (previously, progress only ever changed via
 * an explicit admin action or a client-side "Simulate" session that didn't persist).
 *
 * Paces against `resolveProgressPaceHours` (planningEngine.ts) — this shipment's OWN real
 * promised delivery window (createdAt -> estimatedDeliveryDate, when a usable one is stored)
 * if it has one, otherwise `getServiceCommitmentHours`'s real, distance-based service-level
 * default. This used to pace against a separate, deliberately-compressed "demo" timescale
 * (1.5-9h regardless of the shipment's real promised window) so admins could watch a shipment
 * move within a short testing session — but that meant a shipment promising next-day delivery
 * could show 30%+ complete within minutes of being created, which doesn't correspond to
 * anything the page told the customer. It also meant a manually-overridden ETA (e.g. an admin
 * typing in a custom "3 days from now") was silently ignored for pacing purposes even after
 * the service-level default was fixed — resolveProgressPaceHours closes that gap by
 * preferring the shipment's actual stored dates whenever they're present and sane. An admin
 * who wants to watch a shipment complete faster than its real promised window should use the
 * Simulate panel's speed multipliers (2x-50x) instead — that's what they're for; this
 * automatic background pace should just tell the truth.
 *
 * Also recomputes and persists the vehicle's estimated map position (current_location_lat/lng)
 * to match the newly-advanced progress, along the same synthetic route geometry the map
 * itself falls back to. This is what makes the marker actually move for every viewer, on
 * every device, from one server-authoritative value — not a per-browser animation. It is
 * explicitly an SCHEDULE-BASED ESTIMATE, not a GPS ping: the UI must label it as such
 * ("Estimated Position (Schedule-Based)"), never "Live GPS" or "Live Tracking".
 *
 * Also advances `status` itself from RECEIVED/PROCESSING/AT_FACILITY/DEPARTED_FACILITY/
 * DESTINATION_PROCESSING to IN_TRANSIT once real movement has actually started — this used to
 * only ever touch progress_percent, leaving status permanently frozen (a shipment could sit
 * at 94% progress while still reading "Received at Origin Facility" forever). Still
 * deliberately conservative past that: never auto-advances to OUT_FOR_DELIVERY or DELIVERED,
 * and stops short of 100% — that final confirmation still requires an explicit admin action,
 * same as a real courier's last-mile scan.
